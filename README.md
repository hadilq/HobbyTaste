# HobbyTaste

Just a hobby android project. It contains server side and client side. For running the server side, you have to have
a mysql server database. Then by defining global_serverAddress, global_serverPort and global_serverScheme in
build.gradle file of the root project, you can specify the address of the server. For start you can do this, just
like me, by determining a LAN as the host server. You can find other options in the same place.

For running the client side you have to generate a keystore.properties file, then simply build it.

This project is meant to give you the ability to pick a place on map and let you upload pictures of that place, so
others can comment on that. It's not finished yet, but I'm working on it
